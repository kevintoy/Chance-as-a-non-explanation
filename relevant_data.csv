,,,,,NA,NA,"We may be surprised that a rite, supposed to celebrate the unity of the couple, ultimately shows the disparity of the spouses. Why does this rite lead to their competition which determines, certainly in a playful manner, who â€?the man or the woman â€?will be lucky in life? One might have thought that their shared procreative life would give them a similar destiny, especially since it is the first child they have together who will determine their â€œsign of destinyâ€? But this rivalry, staged in the ritual, reminds us that the matrimonial alliance unites strangers, that it is part of a context of confrontation, between the taking group and the giving group, which is expressed in particular in the way in which the bride is taken to her husband, in the form of real or parodic kidnapping, and in the ritual bare-handed fights which pit the young men representing the husband and the bride two by two. This game between the spouses is in fact only the continuity of the process of oppositions which founds the alliance. This preamble is also thought of as the ritual impulse which will augur their â€œsign of destinyâ€? In other words, what sex will the first born be? The fact that theÂ luckÂ is with the husband or with the wife provides an indication of the sex of the first child. If it is the groom, they will have a son, if it is the bride, it will be a daughter. In theory, only the grown-up woman will have the same â€œsign of destinyâ€?as her husband, unless their union remains sterile. Subsequently, if a man has children by contracting one or more marriages, his â€œsignâ€?will not change, as for his other wives, their â€œsignâ€?will not necessarily correspond to that of their husband. Because the propitiatory rite of marriage only takes place once in his life and only with his first wife. This ritual act, designated in masa by the terms gi vuna, literally â€œthrowing into the mouthâ€? irremediably binds the wife to her husband. Indeed, nothing can break this sacred union, not even death. This is why the widower (or widow) is subject to separation rites from the deceased spouse so that the strength of their union does not lead him or her prematurely to the land of the dead. This bond, which is indissoluble, also confers on spouses a duty of mutual understanding and a power of curse which they can use in the event of disagreement. If the husband wishes to take a second wife without the favorable opinion of his ""grown-up wife"", she will threaten him with sterility or returning empty-handed from fishing or hunting. The husband will make similar threats to dissuade his first wife from leaving him. The reference to the â€œmarriage ritualâ€?is obvious here. It shows that the power that spouses have over each other canÂ [Page 83]Â jointly endanger their fertility as well as their ability to catch fish or game. The Masa in fact believe that the power of procreation is part of a unique function which directs not only the fertility of the individual, but also all production activities. Bad luck at fishing and bad harvests are associated with a form of sterility. We will see later how an individual confronted with this series of misfortunes will ask a child to sow in his place, since his own ""sign of destiny"", his own body, he will also say, is no longer capable of producing . This is why the â€œmarriage ritualâ€?presents itself as a game of luck which should favor the coupleâ€™s procreation. A similar type of staging is also found in the Day wedding rite which we will examine later. It proves that the bride and groom are necessarily thought of as competitors.","On peut s'Ã©tonner qu'un rite, censÃ© cÃ©lÃ©brer l'unitÃ© du couple, montre finalement la disparitÃ© des conjoints. Pourquoi ce rite dÃ©bouche-t-il sur leur mise en compÃ©tition qui dÃ©termine, certes de maniÃ¨re enjouÃ©e, qui â€?de l'homme ou de la femme â€?sera chanceux dans la vie ? On aurait pu penser que leur vie procrÃ©atrice commune leur confÃ©rait un destin similaire, d'autant plus que c'est le premier enfant qu'ils auront ensemble qui fixera leur Â« signe du destin Â». Mais cette rivalitÃ©, mise en scÃ¨ne dans le rituel, rappelle que l'alliance matrimoniale unit des Ã©trangers, qu'elle s'inscrit dans un contexte d'affrontement, entre le groupe preneur et le groupe donneur, qui s'exprime notamment dans la maniÃ¨re dont la mariÃ©e est conduite chez son mari, sous forme d'enlÃ¨vement rÃ©el ou parodique, et dans les luttes rituelles Ã  mains nues qui opposent, deux Ã  deux, les jeunes hommes reprÃ©sentants du mari et de la mariÃ©e. Ce jeu entre les Ã©poux n'est en fait que la continuitÃ© du processus d'oppositions qui fonde l'alliance. Ce prÃ©ambule est aussi pensÃ© comme l'impulsion rituelle qui va augurer de leur Â« signe du destin Â». Autrement dit, de quel sexe sera le premier nÃ© ? Le fait que laÂ chanceÂ soit avec le mari ou avec la femme apporte une indication sur le sexe du premier enfant. S'il s'agit du mariÃ©, ils auront un fils, s'il s'agit de la mariÃ©e, ce sera une fille. En thÃ©orie, seule la grande femme aura le mÃªme Â« signe du destin Â» que son Ã©poux, Ã  moins que leur union ne reste stÃ©rile. Par la suite, si un homme a des enfants en contractant un ou plusieurs mariages, son Â« signe Â» ne changera pas, quant Ã  ses autres Ã©pouses, leur Â« signe Â» ne correspondra pas forcÃ©ment Ã  celui de leur mari. Car, le rite propitiatoire du mariage n'a lieu qu'une seule fois dans sa vie et seulement avec sa premiÃ¨re Ã©pouse. Cet acte rituel, dÃ©signÃ© en masa par les termesÂ gi vuna, littÃ©ralement â€œjeter dans la boucheâ€? lie irrÃ©mÃ©diablement l'Ã©pouse Ã  son mari. En effet, rien ne pourra briser cette union sacrÃ©e, pas mÃªme la mort. C'est pourquoi le veuf (ou la veuve) est soumis Ã  des rites de sÃ©paration d'avec le dÃ©funt conjoint afin que la force de leur union ne l'entraÃ®ne pas prÃ©maturÃ©ment au pays des morts. Ce lien qui est indissoluble confÃ¨re aussi aux conjoints un devoir d'entente mutuelle et un pouvoir de malÃ©diction dont ils peuvent user en cas de dÃ©saccord. Si le mari dÃ©sire prendre une seconde Ã©pouse sans l'avis favorable de sa Â« grande femme Â», celle-ci le menacera de stÃ©rilitÃ© ou de rentrer bredouille de la pÃªche ou de la chasse. Le mari profÃ©rera de pareilles menaces pour dissuader sa premiÃ¨re femme de le quitter. La rÃ©fÃ©rence au Â« rituel du mariage Â» est ici Ã©vidente. Elle montre que le pouvoir dont les Ã©poux disposent l'un envers l'autre peutÂ [Page 83]Â conjointement mettre en pÃ©ril leur fÃ©conditÃ© comme leur capacitÃ© Ã  capturer du poisson ou du gibier. Les Masa pensent en effet que le pouvoir de procrÃ©ation relÃ¨ve d'une fonction unique qui dirige non seulement la fÃ©conditÃ© de l'individu, mais aussi toutes les activitÃ©s de production. La malchance Ã  la pÃªche et les mauvaises rÃ©coltes sont associÃ©es Ã  une forme de stÃ©rilitÃ©. Nous verrons plus loin comment un individu confrontÃ© Ã  cette sÃ©rie de malheurs demandera Ã  un enfant de semer Ã  sa place, puisque son propre Â« signe du destin Â», son propre corps, dira-t-il aussi, n'est plus capable de produire. C'est pourquoi le Â« rituel du mariage Â» se prÃ©sente comme un jeu de laÂ chanceÂ qui doit favoriser la procrÃ©ation du couple.

Polynesia,Maori,,Primarily Hunter-gatherers,,2,4,,"In most, if not all cases, the objects at which the simple uruuru whenua ceremony was performed, were viewed as tipua, and such places were treated with respect. As to the origin of a tipua rock or tree, should an important personÂ chanceÂ to die while on a journey, or should bearers of a corpse stop at a place to rest, then any prominent stone, rock or tree at on near such spot might be viewed hence forth as representing the defunct one, and as a tipua. Natives have told me that it absorbed the wairua or soul of the deceased, which endowed the tipua object with mana or force, inherent powers. Travellers would deposit their simple offering at such an object, not only to secure good luck, such as fine weather for their journey, bat also to uphold the mana of the tipua, that is the innate powers of the talismanic object. The offering, and the brief utterance accompanying it, showed that the observers still kept green the memory of their ancestor and still upheld his mana. A stream in which a dead body has been washed has been treated as a tipua, and in this case the offering consisted in some cases of a stone cast into it. Should any witless person pollute a tipua object by taking near it any cooked article of food, it was believed that the powers of the wairua vivifying the tipua would destroy such person. Natives tell us that, occasionally, when a seer was a member of a party travelling across unknown lands, he would be able to detect any tipua object passed on the way because his spiritual vision enabled him to see the wairua that animated the object. Here it would appear that the wairua or spirit was not enshrined in the object but hovering about it. Branchlets or leaves of the kawakawa and karamu (Piper excelsum and Coprosma sp.) were favoured offerings to an uruuru whenua, those two trees being much employed in ritual performances.",yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,unknown,unknown,unknown,charm,,life events,,,,

,,,,,NA,NA,,"Long years ago an old woman at the village of Uruhau, near Wellington, dreamed that she saw a fire on the ridge known as Te Wharau. This dream was gravely discussed, and was held to be a warning of some danger threatening the hamlet. Two men were despatched to Te Wharau to endeavour to obtain an explanation of the warning, and they encountered on that ridge a party of raiders advancing to attack Uruhau. SuchÂ chanceÂ occurrences as this caused the Maori to place great faith in dreams. The old woman's wairua had, during a jaunt abroad, seen this danger threatening its basis, and had returned to warn that basis. Such is the reasoning of the Maori.",yes,yes,yes,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,,,misfortune,,"misfortune predicted by dream; ""chance"" misfortunes reinforces the validity of dreams",,
Polynesia,Tongans,,Horticulturalists,,1,1,,"Since the monarch is not viewed by Tongans generally as a creation ofÂ chanceÂ but rather of God's ordinance, the status of his being must be upheld with proper rituals. Not performing what is considered right can be seen as disrespect to the hierarchy, and disrespect to the hierarchy is seen as breaking an important social tapu which will bring mala to people concerned. To this end, people would go without good food for days and spend much on customary feasts. Those who do so argue that it is much more important for the Tongan people as a whole to feel well socially than physically.",unknown,unknown,unknown,yes,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,God,,warfare and politics,,,,
Amazon and Orinoco,Saramaka,,Other Subsistence Combinations,,1,1,,"The distinctive character of Saramaka social life is molded also by another, quite different set of assumptions, involving the place of Man in the Universe. Saramaka cosmology is grounded in the belief that every event has a determinate cause which is, potentially at least, discoverable through divination; the concepts of Fate orÂ ChanceÂ are not germane to Saramaka thought. 7 7 Hurault claims, on the contrary, that in Aluku, hunting mishaps and even death may be attributed toÂ chance. But he arrives at this conclusion by mis-translating ongooku as â€?accident naturel â€?(1961:237). OngÃ³Ã³ku , in Saramaka at least, happens to include the class of events English or French refers to as â€?accident â€?(or Dutch as â€?ongeluk â€?, but means instead â€œespecially evil misfortune,â€?whose very specific causes must be determined and acted on in each case. There is a relentless insistence on determinacy, what might seem almost like an obsession with causality, (a concern which LÃ©vi-Strauss suggests is the defining feature of magical thought in general [1962:18]). Sociologically, the key belief is that Man is the ultimate source of Evil in the world; the cause of all misfortunes are human misdeeds â€?whether ancient offenses, current sacrileges, or current social crimes. And, just as all misfortune stems from human wrongs, every offense will someday bear its bitter fruit. Historicity in Saramaka is very much a two-way street.",unknown,unknown,unknown,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,taboo violations,,misfortune,,,yes,
,,,,,NA,NA,,"The younger KaapÃªltÃ¹k, the research assistant council, and I spent a number of days studying â€œchanceâ€?as a concept. They were familiar with the word for â€œaccidentâ€?in Portuguese ( acidente ), but this term could be applied only to an automobile accident. I tried to apply it to events concurring by accident (chance), but this concept was not acceptable. For these research assistants, everything that occurred had to have an antecedent cause or set of preceding causes, and the cause or causes could not be random placement or timing: elements or events coming together coincidentally. Thus, because of the lack of a key expression in the semantic area for â€œchance,â€?I concluded that there is no such Canela concept, at least not in the Western sense. This observation is supported by the limited degree to whichÂ chanceÂ enters into any of their sports and games [II.F. 3 ], and into their life in general.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,no,no,no,,,life events,,,yes,
